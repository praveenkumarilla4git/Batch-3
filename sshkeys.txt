Step 1: Check if SSH keys exist

Run this in Git Bash:

ls -al ~/.ssh


If you see files like id_rsa and id_rsa.pub or id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub, it means keys exist.
If no such files, generate a new one.

🪄 Step 2: Generate a new SSH key (if missing)

Run:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


(Replace with your GitHub email)

Press Enter for all prompts (it will save under ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 by default).

🔐 Step 3: Start the SSH agent and add your key

Run these commands:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

🧷 Step 4: Add your public key to GitHub

Show the key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Copy the full output.

Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.

Paste the copied key → Save.

🧭 Step 5: Test the connection

Run:

ssh -T git@github.com


Expected output:

Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated...


If you see this — your SSH connection is fixed ✅

🛠 Step 6: Verify your remote URL

Run:

git remote -v


If the URL starts with https://, it’s better to switch to SSH:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git


Example:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:PraveenKumar/myrepo.git

🚀 Step 7: Push your changes again
git push origin main


If you still get a Permission denied error after all this, show me the output of:

ssh -vT git@github.com


and

git remote -v


Then I’ll pinpoint the issue exactly.

Would you like me to give you the exact commands to copy–paste for your username and repo (based on your setup)?

Perfect — this screenshot helps a lot 👇

I can see your ~/.ssh directory contains a key file named saitest1, but there’s no .pub file visible (e.g., saitest1.pub).
That means either:

The public key file wasn’t generated, or

It’s saved in a different folder.

Let’s fix and connect this properly step-by-step 👇

🧩 Step 1: Check if a public key exists

Run:

ls -l ~/.ssh/saitest1.pub


If it exists, great — go to Step 2.

If it says “No such file or directory”, create a new key pair.

🪄 Step 2 (if missing): Generate a new SSH key

Run this (replace email with your GitHub email):

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


When it asks for a file path, type:

~/.ssh/saitest1


and press Enter for all prompts.

This will create both:

~/.ssh/saitest1

~/.ssh/saitest1.pub

🔐 Step 3: Add key to SSH agent

Run:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/saitest1


You should see:

Identity added: /c/Users/<user>/.ssh/saitest1

🧷 Step 4: Add public key to GitHub

Show your public key:

cat ~/.ssh/saitest1.pub


Then:

Copy the full output.

Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.

Paste it → give it a name (e.g., “Laptop Git Bash”) → Save.

🧭 Step 5: Verify your connection

Run:

ssh -T git@github.com


Expected:

Hi <your-username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.


If you see this — connection fixed ✅

🛠 Step 6: Update your repo’s remote URL (if needed)

Run:

git remote -v


If it starts with https://, change it to SSH:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo-name>.git


Example:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:praveenkumarilla459/Batch_3.git

🚀 Step 7: Try pushing again
git push origin main


Can you please run:

ls ~/.ssh/saitest1.pub


and tell me if that file exists?
That’ll decide whether we reuse the existing key or create a fresh one.

You said:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
which email id should i mention what is the meaning of -t?
should i give my github email id?
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question, Praveen 👏

Let’s break this down clearly —

🔍 Command Explanation
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

🧩 1. ssh-keygen

This is the command used to generate a new SSH key pair (a public and private key).

🔑 2. -t ed25519

This flag means “type of key.”

-t stands for type.

ed25519 is a modern, secure encryption algorithm — faster and more secure than older RSA keys.
👉 It’s the recommended key type by GitHub.

📨 3. -C "your_email@example.com"

This is just a comment/label attached to your key — usually your GitHub account email, so that if you have multiple keys, you can identify which one belongs to which account or device.

✅ So yes — you should use your GitHub email ID here.

In your case, use:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "praveenkumarilla459@gmail.com"

🧠 What this command will do:

It will create two files in your ~/.ssh folder:

id_ed25519 → your private key (keep it safe, never share it)

id_ed25519.pub → your public key (you’ll upload this one to GitHub)

Would you like me to show you the exact steps to generate and add it to GitHub after this command?
(I’ll include what to press for each prompt so it’s 100% smooth.)

ChatGPT said:

Perfect ✅ — your SSH key pair was successfully generated!

You now have:

Private key: /c/Users/prave/.ssh/id_ed25519

Public key: /c/Users/prave/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Let’s complete the setup in a few quick steps 👇

🧩 Step 1: Add the key to the SSH agent

Run these two commands:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


You should see something like:

Agent pid 1234
Identity added: /c/Users/prave/.ssh/id_ed25519

🧷 Step 2: Copy your public key

Run this command:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Then copy the entire line it prints — it will look like this:

ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nz... your_email@gmail.com

🖥️ Step 3: Add the key to GitHub

Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
(Direct link: https://github.com/settings/keys
)

Click New SSH key

Title: Laptop Git Bash

Paste the copied public key

Click Add SSH key

🧭 Step 4: Test your connection

Run:

ssh -T git@github.com


If everything’s correct, you’ll see:

Hi praveenkumarilla459! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.


✅ That confirms your SSH setup is working.

⚙️ Step 5: (Optional) Make sure your repo uses SSH instead of HTTPS

Run:

git remote -v


If you see an HTTPS link like:

https://github.com/username/repo.git


change it to SSH:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git


Then finally try:

git push origin main


Would you like to show me the output of git remote -v next?
I can confirm whether your local repo is using HTTPS or SSH before you push.

You said:
$ git remote -v
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
ChatGPT said:

Excellent — that message actually gives us a very clear clue 👇

fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


It means:
👉 You are not currently inside a Git-tracked project folder — i.e., there’s no .git folder in your current directory (~/Downloads/Batch_3).

Let’s confirm and fix this step by step 👇

🧩 Step 1: Check if the folder is a Git repo

Run:

ls -a


If you don’t see a .git folder, then Git is not initialized in this folder (or you’re in the wrong path).

🪄 Step 2: Check if your project is somewhere else

Maybe your Git repo is one level up or in another folder.
Try:

cd ..
ls -a


and see if another folder (maybe inside Downloads) has a .git directory.

🧠 Step 3: If this is a new project — initialize Git

If you intend to make this Batch_3 folder a repo, initialize it:

cd ~/Downloads/Batch_3
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"

🖥️ Step 4: Link it to your GitHub repository

Once you know your GitHub repo name, run:

git remote add origin git@github.com:praveenkumarilla459/<your-repo-name>.git


Example:

git remote add origin git@github.com:praveenkumarilla459/Batch_3.git

🧭 Step 5: Verify
git remote -v


You should now see:

origin  git@github.com:praveenkumarilla459/Batch_3.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:praveenkumarilla459/Batch_3.git (push)

🚀 Step 6: Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


Can you please run:

ls -a


inside your Downloads/Batch_3 folder and share the output?
That’ll confirm if it’s already a Git repo or if we need to reinitialize it.


=====================================================

git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.



Please make sure you have the correct access rights

and the repository exists.



That error, git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey), is a very common issue when trying to interact with a Git repository on GitHub using SSH. It means that when your computer tried to connect to GitHub, GitHub couldn't verify your identity using the SSH key you provided.

Here's a breakdown of the most likely causes and the steps you can take to fix it.

Causes and Solutions
1. The SSH Key Isn't Registered with GitHub 🔑
You need to have generated an SSH key pair and added the public key to your GitHub account settings.

Solution Steps
Check for existing keys: Open your terminal and run:

Bash

ls -al ~/.ssh
Look for files named like id_rsa, id_ecdsa, id_ed25519, or similar, with and without a .pub extension. The file without the .pub extension is your private key; the one with it is your public key.

Generate a new key (if needed): If you don't have one, or want a fresh key, run:

Bash

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Follow the prompts (accepting the default location is usually fine).

Add the public key to GitHub:

Copy your public key to your clipboard. For a key named id_ed25519.pub, run:

Bash

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.

Give it a descriptive title and paste the entire key content into the "Key" field.

Click Add SSH key.

2. The SSH Agent Isn't Running or Doesn't Have Your Key
The SSH agent is a background program that holds your decrypted private keys in memory so you don't have to enter your passphrase every time.

Solution Steps
Start the agent:

Bash

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add your private key: If your key is named id_ed25519 (a modern default), run:

Bash

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
You may be prompted for the passphrase you set when creating the key.

3. The Remote URL is Incorrect (You're Not Using the SSH URL) 🔗
The error explicitly points to a public key issue, which happens when you're using the SSH protocol (git@github.com:). However, ensure the remote URL in your local repository is actually set to the SSH URL and hasn't accidentally switched to the HTTPS URL.

Solution Steps
Check the current remote URL:

Bash

git remote -v
Correct (SSH) URL format: git@github.com:user/repo.git
Incorrect (HTTPS) URL format: https://github.com/user/repo.git

Change the remote URL (if needed): If it's HTTPS, you need to change it to the SSH format:

Bash

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
(Replace origin with your remote name if different, and replace USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git with the correct path.)

Final Verification Step
After attempting the solutions above, you can test your connection to GitHub to ensure everything is working:

Bash

ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message like:

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

If you see that, the SSH key is working, and your Git command should now succeed!
