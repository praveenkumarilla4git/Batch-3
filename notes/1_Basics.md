2\. **IP-enabled device**

An IP-enabled device is any device that can connect to a network (like the Internet or a local network) using an IP address (Internet Protocol address). This allows it to send and receive data.

Example: Smartphones, computers, printers, routers, CCTV cameras — all these become IP-enabled when assigned an IP address.

An IP-enabled device is any machine (including computers) that can communicate over a network using an IP address.



3\. **What is Operating System**?

An Operating System (OS) is a system software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user.

It manages the hardware resources of a computer and provides an environment where applications can run.

**Key Functions of an Operating System**:

**Process Management** – Handles running programs, their execution, and multitasking.

**Memory Management** – Allocates and manages system memory (RAM).

**File System Management** – Organizes, stores, retrieves, and secures files on storage devices.

**Device Management** – Controls input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.).

**Security \& Access Control** – Protects data and resources from unauthorized access.

**User Interface** – Provides a way for users to interact with the system (CLI like Linux shell or GUI like Windows).

**Examples of Operating Systems**:

**Windows** (Windows 10, Windows 11)

**Linux** (Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora)

**MacOS** (Apple systems)

**Android** (Mobile OS)

**iOS** (Apple mobile devices)

An Operating System = Manager of hardware + Provider of platform for software + Interface for the user.
