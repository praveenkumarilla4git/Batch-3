uname
uname -a

date --> current date
who --> who tells user details (how many users are currently logged in; which user logged in when)
whoami --> displays who has run this command
which --> gives us the location of the command in OS example --> which bash --> /usr/bin/bash
==============================
id --> uid=1000(ec2-user) gid=1000(ec2-user) groups=1000(ec2-user),4(adm),10(wheel),190(systemd-journal) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

id gives user details which groups they belong and which groups are present in the machine

uid=1000(ec2-user) ### this is user id
gid=1000(ec2-user) ### this is group id

a user cannot create another user; only a super user can create another user
