create an example.txt file
Ans: touch example.txt

write "Hi Hello, How are you?" into the file
cat > Hi Hello, How are you? <Enter>
<Ctrl + D>

now to check if the text given is stored in the file or not 
you can check with the command cat example.txt

now, apply grep in this file.
meaning find the Hi word is present in the example.txt or not

grep "Hi" example.txt --- this command will print the whole line which has "Hi" in it in the example.txt

If you just want to check whether "Hi" exists in the file (without printing the line), you can use:

grep -q "Hi" example.txt && echo "Found" || echo "Not Found"
