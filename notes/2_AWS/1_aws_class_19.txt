linux OS --> required enhanced features --> Amazon Machine Image --> AMI

Regions
Availability Zones AZ

EC2 --> Elastic Compute Cloud (Virtual Machine)

Linux
AMI  --> free tier
t3.micro --> free



Client Server Architecture
==========================

Client 					--> Server 
key							key
private key				Public Key

Linux Server --> Clients --> AWS (Linux Ipaddress username password)
cmd prompt, git bash, mobxtream

Windows --> \ (backward)
Linux --> / (forward)


Our intention is to create Public key and Private key

ssh-keygen -f batch3
batch3
batch3.pub


key pair import into aws
keypairs --> option --> name --> .pub 

firewall
inbound (incoming)--> SSH --> Port
outbound (outgoing) --> All traffic

EC2 instance is up

ssh -i <privat-key> username@ipaddress
ssh -i batch3 ec2-user@13.62.50.92
