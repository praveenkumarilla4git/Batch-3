#!/bin/bash --> shebang
this line signifies that the shell script should use the bash
if we use #!/bin/dash --> it will tell script should be run using dash
like wise if we #!/bin/sh --> it will tell script should be run using default scripting language set in the OS where the script is running. Some OS will use bash as default, some use ksh as default like that so shebang is very important that the sccripts we run should be run smoothly

#!/bin/bash --> shebang
echo "My name is Praveen"

ls --> list the files and folders present in the current working directory
pwd --> displays the present working directory path

touch --> this command is used to create a new file 
touch <filename>

cat
vim
chmod 777 <filename>
Each file is owned by a particular user and a group and assigned with permission access rights for three different classes of users:

The file owner.
The group members.
Others (everybody else).

File permissions can be viewed using the ls command. Here is an example:

ls -l filename.txt

-rw-r--r-- 12 linuxize users 12.0K Oct  8 20:51 filename.txt
|[-][-][-]-   [------] [---]
| |  |  | |      |       |
| |  |  | |      |       +-----------> 7. Group
| |  |  | |      +-------------------> 6. Owner
| |  |  | +--------------------------> 5. Alternate Access Method
| |  |  +----------------------------> 4. Others Permissions
| |  +-------------------------------> 3. Group Permissions
| +----------------------------------> 2. Owner Permissions
+------------------------------------> 1. File Type


The write, read, and execute permissions have the following number value:

r (read) = 4
w (write) = 2
x (execute) = 1
no permissions = 0

nproc --> gives CPU info
free --> 
top --> gives info about processes running in the machine

top command shows a live, updating view of:
System load (CPU usage)
Memory usage
Swap usage
Running processes
Process IDs (PIDs)
User running each process


#############
free command
this command displays

The free command displays:
Total, used, and available memory (RAM)
Swap memory usage
Helps monitor memory usage and detect if the system is running low on RAM

example:
Mem:  1987036  771200  532300  9500  683536  1083200
Total memory = 1,987,036 KB (~1.9 GB)

Used = 771,200 KB (~753 MB)

Free = 532,300 KB (~520 MB)

Buff/cache = 683,536 KB (~667 MB)

Available = 1,083,200 KB (~1.06 GB

df
The df command (Disk Filesystem) displays:

How much disk space is used

How much space is available

Which filesystem (partition or mount point) it belongs to

Example output:

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1       20G  7.2G   13G  37% /
tmpfs           977M     0  977M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           977M  852K  976M   1% /run
tmpfs           977M     0  977M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup

Filesystem	Name of the disk/partition (e.g., /dev/xvda1)
Size	Total disk size
Used	How much space is used
Avail	How much space is available
Use%	Percentage of disk used
Mounted on	Mount point (where the filesystem is attached, e.g., /, /home, etc.)
