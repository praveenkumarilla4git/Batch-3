DevOps team --> Group

=========================================================

1. Create User
2. Create Group
3. Assign User to a specific Group
4. Remove User from a specific Group
5. Remove User
6. Remove Group

Honey
Users first remove
then empty Honey group
delete honey group

1. create devops group
2. create Suresh User
3. add Suresh to devops group  
4. Remove Suresh from devops group
5. Remove Suresh user

useradd suresh --> user suresh will be created
groupadd devops --> creates devops group

root user 
sudo su -
Super User do --> Super User - --> Switch

===== 
sudo su -
whoami
root

useradd suresh
groupadd devops

id suresh
uid=1001(suresh) gid=1001(suresh) groups=1001(suresh)

user id is 1001
group id is suresh
groups which suresh belongs only one group for now which is suresh

when we first time create a user there will be a default user created and default group with same name created as group

id suresh
cat /etc/passwd

suresh:x:1001:1001:<description>:/home/suresh:/bin/bash


cat /etc/group
all groups available in the machine will be displayed

suresh:x:1001:
devops:x:1002:
aruna:x:1003:

cat /etc/shadow --> displays encryted passwords list (cannot see the passwords as they are encrypted)

uid=1001(suresh) gid=1001(suresh) groups=1001(suresh)

gid=1001(suresh) (1 primary group)
groups=1001(suresh) (1 secondary group {atleast one secondary group})
meaning if suresh has been added into any other (for instance devops) 
new group which suresh has been added into will be listed in secondary groups when we hit id suresh

we are trying add suresh into devops group
usermod -g <group-name> <user-name>
usermod -g devops suresh
id suresh
uid=1001(suresh) gid=1002(devops) groups=1002(devops)

Suresh should be in devops group
Along with that he also should be present in another group (for instance say operation)

groupadd operations
suresh should be in devops group and also in operations

usermod -aG <group name (new)> <user-name>
usermod -aG operations suresh 

id suresh
uid=1001(suresh) gid=1002(devops) groups=1002(devops)
usermod -aG operations suresh
id suresh
uid=1001(suresh) gid=1002(devops) groups=1002(devops),1004(operations)

id aruna
uid=1002(aruna) gid=1003(aruna) groups=1003(aruna)
usermod -aG devops aruna
id aruna
uid=1002(aruna) gid=1003(aruna) groups=1003(aruna),1002(devops)

[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# id aruna
uid=1002(aruna) gid=1003(aruna) groups=1003(aruna),1005(testing)
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# usermod -aG devops aruna
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# id aruna
uid=1002(aruna) gid=1003(aruna) groups=1003(aruna),1002(devops),1005(testing)
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# usermod -aG operations aruna
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# id aruna
uid=1002(aruna) gid=1003(aruna) groups=1003(aruna),1002(devops),1004(operations),1005(testing)
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]#



Username --> Password
passwd <username>

whoami
root --> Admin
When we are admin then we can set a passwd to new user

command:
-------
passwd <username>

passwd praveen
confirm passwords a couple of times

[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# passwd praveen
Changing password for user praveen.
New password:
BAD PASSWORD: The password fails the dictionary check - it is based on a dictionary word
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

passwd is assigned to praveen

/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> this is ssh configuration system file we need to be very cautious with this file
in this file we need to make sure the password authentication is enabled
before:
PasswordAuthentication no
after:
PasswordAuthentication yes

be very careful with this file
double check

after editing if we need to know that there are no issues we need to check for syntax
to check the syntax we need to run a command
command:
sshd -t
if this results in empty then we are good
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# sshd -t
When the result to this command is empty it means everything is fine

[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[root@ip-172-31-26-93 ~]# sshd -t
/etc/ssh/sshd_config line 65: unsupported option "yes!".
if there is any problem with the syntax it will throw error like above
